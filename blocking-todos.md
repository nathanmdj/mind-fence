 Next steps for full functionality:

  1. Implement app selection UI - Create a page where users can see installed apps
  and select which ones to block
  2. Request required permissions - Guide users through granting Usage Stats,
  Accessibility service, and other permissions
  3. Test actual blocking - Once apps are selected and permissions granted, test that
   the blocking actually prevents app usage

  The core blocking infrastructure is now working correctly. The missing piece is the
   user interface to select which apps to block and the permission request flow.
